Hi, I'm Carlos, a Software Engineer passionate about building products from the ground up.

Currently building the best software for Auto Repair Shop Owners at <Link href="https://www.shopgenie.io/" className="transition-colors duration-300 ease-in-out hover:text-main-accent underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopgenie</Link>.

Throughout my career, I've worked on small, high-impact teams where
I've contributed to projects ranging from geolocation solutions in the security sectorto high-availability APIs
that serve hundreds of thousands of users worldwide in the travel space.

I thrive on tackling challenging problems and am always eager to learn more about the technologies that fascinate me.

Outside of tech my hobbies include motorsports, tennis, and hitting the gym.
