Hi, I'm Carlos, a Software Engineer who loves building products end-to-end.

I’ve spent all of my professional career being a builder on small,
high-impact, high-agency teams with products that range from
Geolocation projects to high-availability APIs serving hundreds of
thousands of users across the globe.

I love working on hard problems. I’ve always been keen on learning
more and more about stuff that I like (which is almost always tech
related stuff) and been really lucky to have landed on teams that
would nurture my hard and soft skills.

Building products from working on the initial definition of the
problem to building the user interfaces and creating the back-end
services that power them. At the beginning of my career I started
working on the geo-localization industry building products that used
data from custom geo-location devices of mobile devices depending on
the customer’s needs using the full-stack.

The next step was building products powering the connections between
Online Travel Agencies and Airlines to distribute Ticket and
Ancillaries working with the biggest names in the travel industry.
Outside of tech I really like Motorsports in general and playing
tennis. I also frequent the gym and like to live a healthy lifestyle
(as best as I can).
